# An Introduction to Programming and Object-Oriented Programming in Java

## Welcome!

This is a free introduction to programming and object-oriented programming in Java. It consists of a sequence of lessons. Each lesson contains a reading with contained exercises (most of which are linked to solutions), followed by a lab assignment to practice with the new tools and concepts.

## Who is this for?

This is for anyone who wants to learn to program. No prior programming experience is expected, though some familiarity with computers and search engines is assumed. If you're an independent learner, it is perfectly reasonable to go through these labs without an instructor.

This is also for educators looking to break away from the standard of offloading the cost of educational materials onto students. Tuition is expensive! Textbooks don't have to be. Feel free to use the entire series for your courses, or to pick and choose the parts that you like. If you're an educator and plan to use these materials, please [read the terms of use](#termsOfUse). They are very brief, and you will not be asked to pay for anything.

## Let's get started!

The following lessons should have all of the information that you need to complete them. They are intended to be done sequentially; each lab assumes knowledge from those before it. Click on any of the links below to be taken to the corresponding lesson.

1. [Environment Setup and "Hello World!"](https://github.com/arewhyaeenn/OOP_HELLO_WORLD)
2. [Java Fundamentals](https://github.com/arewhyaeenn/OOP_JAVA_FUNDAMENTALS)
3. [Classes, Objects, and Static Methods](https://github.com/arewhyaeenn/OOP_CLASSES_OBJECTS_METHODS)
4. [Flow of Control](https://github.com/arewhyaeenn/OOP_FLOW_OF_CONTROL)
5. [Arrays, Strings and Regular Expressions](https://github.com/arewhyaeenn/OOP_ARRAYS_STRINGS_REGEX)
6. [Classes as "Object Blueprints"](https://github.com/arewhyaeenn/OOP_CLASSES_CONSTRUCTION_OBJECTS)
7. [Pillars of OOP via Interfaces](https://github.com/arewhyaeenn/OOP_PILLARS_1)
8. [Pillars of OOP via Abstract Classes](https://github.com/arewhyaeenn/OOP_PILLARS_2)

Lessons vary in length. They are intended to take 1-2 weeks each in a standard 4-unit course, including a lecture and practice quiz, both covering the same material as the reading. Eventually these practice quizzes will be moved to [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com) and linked in their corresponding lessons.

## How to Contribute

I believe that access to education should be equal and uninhibited to the degree possible. As such, I believe educational materials should be free. That is not to say that authors shouldn't be compensated, only that their compensation need not contribute to the financial barriers to education.

If you like what I do, and want to contribute, here are some ways you can do so:

* Make pull requests with improvements to these labs.
* Make and share free materials for other topics.
* Email me with comments, suggestions, and feedback at <a href="mailto:ryan.mcintyre732@gmail.com">ryan.mcintyre732@gmail.com</a>.
